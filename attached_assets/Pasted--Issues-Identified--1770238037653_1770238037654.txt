  1. Text-only mode bug for resumed sessions (interview.tsx:902)
                                                                                                                                                          
  For resumed sessions in text-only mode, clicking the mic button triggers the PAUSE action instead of starting the interview. The condition isListening 
  || (isTextOnlyMode && isConnected) evaluates to true even when the resumed session hasn't been activated yet.

  // Line 902: This condition is too broad for text-only resumed sessions
  } else if (isListening || (isTextOnlyMode && isConnected)) {
    // PAUSE branch - but text-only resumed sessions incorrectly enter here

  2. hasSentResumeRef not reset on WebSocket disconnect (interview.tsx)

  If the WebSocket disconnects and reconnects during an active (non-paused) interview:
  - hasSentResumeRef stays true from the initial resume
  - After reconnection, if isPaused was false, clicking mic falls to the else branch
  - Since hasSentResumeRef.current is still true, resume_interview is NOT sent
  - The AI may not know to respond even though audio capture restarts

  3. isPaused not reset in WebSocket onclose (interview.tsx:464-470)

  When the WebSocket closes, isPaused is not reset:
  ws.onclose = () => {
    setIsConnected(false);
    setIsConnecting(false);
    setIsListening(false);
    // isPaused not reset - can lead to inconsistent state
  };

  4. Visual state mismatch for paused sessions

  When resuming a session that was previously paused (server status = "paused"), the client isPaused state is initialized to false, so the mic button
  shows "mic off" instead of "play" (paused) icon, even though the session was paused.

  The Good News

  The core pause/resume flow for voice mode on fresh and initially-resumed sessions appears to work correctly. The recent changes properly prevent the AI
  from auto-speaking on resume by:
  - Setting isListening = false when message.isResumed is true
  - Server skipping auto-trigger for isRestoredSession
  - Requiring user to click mic to send resume_interview
