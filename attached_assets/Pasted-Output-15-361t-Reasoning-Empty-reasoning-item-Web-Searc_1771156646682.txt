    "summary": "The UK population was estimated at 68.3 million at mid‑2023, with growth driven mainly by net migration; England and Wales alone reached 61.1m by mid‑2023 and 61.8m by mid‑2024 after revisions. The population is ageing (median age mid‑2024: England 40.2; Wales 42.8; Scotland 42.8; Northern Ireland 40.3). Most residents live in built‑up areas (c. 94.6% in England & Wales). In 2021 England & Wales were 81.7% White overall; 16.8% of residents were born outside the UK (London 40.6%); 91.1% reported English (or Welsh in Wales) as a main language, with 1.8% reporting limited proficiency. Disabled people (Equality Act definition) comprised about 17.8% across England & Wales in 2021. These compositional facts help explain why shared‑space etiquette, queuing norms, indirect speech, and face‑saving repair are both salient and variably interpreted across regions, ages, and migration histories.
