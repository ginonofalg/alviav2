What the code confirms                                                                                                                                             
 1. Barbara already receives previousQuestionSummaries — these are generated when each question completes and include summaries, key insights, completeness assessments, verbatims, and quality scores.                                                                                                                        
  2. But she ALSO gets the full transcript on top of that — the user prompt includes the formatted transcript twice: once as the "Full Transcript So Far" and once  filtered as "Respondent's Answer to Current Question." So there's already redundancy.
  3. The cost is quadratic, not linear — Barbara is called after every respondent utterance, and each call includes the growing transcript. A 10-question interview with 64 turns means ~64 calls with progressively larger prompts. Replit's estimate of 300K-500K cumulative input tokens per interview is realistic.                
  4. The 100-entry cap is both a cost ceiling and a quality ceiling — once hit, Barbara loses early context entirely rather than gracefully degrading to summaries.

  My recommended next steps:
  
  The hybrid approach is clearly the right move, and the infrastructure is already 80% there. Here's what I'd suggest:

  Step 1: Measure first (quick)

  Before changing anything, add lightweight token counting to Barbara calls so you have real before/after data. You already have performanceMetrics JSONB on sessions
   — just extend it.

  Step 2: Implement the hybrid prompt (the real work)

  In barbara-orchestrator.ts, modify the user prompt construction (~lines 371-442) to:
  - Completed questions: Use previousQuestionSummaries only (summaries + verbatims + quality flags). Drop raw transcript for these.
  - Current question: Include full raw transcript entries for the current questionIndex.
  - Previous questions (2 back): Include raw transcript for continuity/overlap detection.
  - Remove the full "Transcript Summary" section that currently dumps all 100 entries.

  This keeps Barbara's context quality high while making prompt size roughly proportional to the current question's length, not the entire interview.

  Step 3: Remove the 100-entry cap concern

  With the hybrid approach, the cap becomes irrelevant — you'd only ever send raw transcript for 1-2 questions at a time, which is far fewer than 100 entries.

  ---
  Bottom line: The hybrid approach isn't just a nice-to-have optimization — it's necessary for cost control and it actually improves quality for longer interviews
  since Barbara will never lose early context (summaries persist). The existing questionSummaries infrastructure means the implementation is relatively
  straightforward.
