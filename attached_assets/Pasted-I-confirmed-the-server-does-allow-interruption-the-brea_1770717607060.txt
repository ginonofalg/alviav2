I confirmed the server does allow interruption; the break is in the browser client. I’m checking git history on that exact line to identify when/why this
  gating was introduced so you can tie it to the behavior change you noticed.

• I’ve confirmed the exact mechanism: the mic stream stays open, but the client drops outbound audio frames whenever isAiSpeaking is true, so provider-side
  interrupt_response never gets the user speech. I’m preparing a small fix to allow outbound mic audio during AI speech again (restoring barge-in behavior).

• I’ve applied the fix and verified the key path: the provider already supports interruption, and the server forwards mic audio unless paused; the issue was
  the client-side drop. I’ll send you a concise root-cause summary plus what changed and what to test next.

• Client mic frames were deliberately dropped when AI was speaking due to a line synchronization check added in a commit on Feb 5, 2026. This caused the
  provider not to see speech, making interrupt_response ineffective. The mic was not hardware muted but functionally muted for outbound audio during that
  time. The recent patch removes that gating.

  Key file changes:

  - client/src/pages/interview.tsx:1149 now always sends audio except during silence pauses.
  - server/realtime-providers.ts:81 retains interrupt_response set to true.
  - server/voice-interview.ts:3275 continues to forward audio unless paused or awaiting resume.

  Testing notes:

  - npm run check fails due to unrelated, pre-existing type errors in analytics/routes/barbara; no errors originate from the updated client file.

  Next steps to verify:

  - Restart the development server and confirm interruptions behave correctly.
  - If delays persist, try clearing any queued playback; a follow-up patch may be needed.

• You’re right to question this. Root cause was client-side, not interrupt_response.

  - interrupt_response: true is still correctly set (server/realtime-providers.ts:81).
  - Server still forwards incoming mic audio to the provider unless paused (server/voice-interview.ts:3275).
  - But the browser client had a hard gate dropping mic frames while Alvia was speaking, so your interruption never reached provider VAD (client/src/pages/
    interview.tsx, previously at the onaudioprocess block).

  So: the mic was not OS-muted, but it was effectively muted for outbound streaming while Alvia talked.

  I removed that gate in client/src/pages/interview.tsx:1149, so barge-in should work again.

  Note on “what changed”: this behavior likely became noticeable after the Feb 5, 2026 refactor that made that AI-speaking gate reliably active.

  Validation:

  - Ran npm run check; it fails due pre-existing unrelated TypeScript errors in other files (ProjectAnalyticsView, server/routes.ts, server/barbara-
    orchestrator.ts, etc.), not from this interview-page change.

  Next step:

  1. Restart and test a live interview by speaking over Alvia mid-sentence; she should now cut off/respond to interruption.
