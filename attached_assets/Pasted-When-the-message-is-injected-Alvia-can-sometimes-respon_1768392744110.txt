When the message is injected, Alvia can sometimes respond in slightly unnatural ways. Simulate how an injected message might read, and suggest prompt           
  improvements so Alvia doesn't respond to these injections as if they've come from the interviewee.                                                              

● Current Problem

  What the conversation looks like to Alvia:

  [RESPONDENT]: ...and that's why I left my previous job. The culture just wasn't right for me.

  [USER]: [System: The respondent touched on career challenges earlier. Briefly acknowledge this connection and invite any additional thoughts, then read the question: "What obstacles have you faced in your professional journey?"]

  Awkward Alvia responses:

  1. "Thank you for that system message. You mentioned career challenges..." - Acknowledges the injection
  2. "I see you've noted that we discussed this earlier..." - Treats it as respondent speech
  3. "Sure, I'll ask about obstacles now..." - Breaks the fourth wall
  4. "You're right, they did mention that..." - Talks about respondent in third person to them

  Suggested Improvements

  Option 1: Change the wrapper format to be more clearly distinguishable:

  text: `<<<ORCHESTRATOR_GUIDANCE>>>
  ${transitionInstruction}
  <<<END_GUIDANCE>>>`

  Option 2: Use a different role convention - prefix with interviewer self-talk:

  text: `[Internal note to self: ${transitionInstruction}]`

  Option 3: Add explicit instruction in the wrapper:

  text: `[ORCHESTRATOR - DO NOT READ ALOUD OR ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE DIRECTLY: ${transitionInstruction}]`

  Option 4 (Recommended): Update Alvia's base system instructions to handle this pattern. Check buildInterviewInstructions():

  // Add to Alvia's system prompt:
  `
  ORCHESTRATOR MESSAGES:
  You will occasionally receive messages wrapped in [System: ...] brackets. These are guidance from Barbara, your orchestrator. When you see these:
  - DO NOT read them aloud or acknowledge receiving them
  - DO NOT respond as if the respondent said them
  - Simply follow the guidance naturally as if it were your own thought
  - Seamlessly continue the conversation with the respondent

  Best approach: Combine Option 3 + Option 4. Update both the injection format AND Alvia's base instructions.
