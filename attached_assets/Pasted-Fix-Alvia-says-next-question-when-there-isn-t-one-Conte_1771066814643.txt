Fix: Alvia says "next question" when there isn't one   

 Context

 Alvia sometimes tells respondents to "move to the next question" when they're on the last question — either the final template question
 or the final additional question (AQ). This happens because of three compounding gaps in the last-question awareness chain.

 Root Causes

 1. Hardcoded guidance message — When Barbara suggests suggest_next_question, the guidance injected into Alvia's prompt always says "shall
  we move to the next question?" with no check for whether a next question actually exists. This overrides Alvia's base instruction #12
 which says "if last question, don't mention next question." (voice-interview.ts:2139-2142)
 2. Barbara analysis runs unchecked during AQ phase — Neither call site guards against isInAdditionalQuestionsPhase. During AQ,
 currentQuestionIndex points past the template array, so Barbara gets an undefined question and can still emit suggest_next_question.
 Worse, the guidance injection then calls buildInterviewInstructions() (template-oriented), overwriting Alvia's AQ instructions entirely.
 (voice-interview.ts:1594,2383,2150)
 3. AQ instructions lack last-question safeguard — buildAQInstructions tells Alvia "This is additional question X of Y" but has no
 instruction to avoid mentioning "next question" on the last AQ. (voice-interview.ts:3307-3351)

 Changes

 1. Make guidance message context-aware (Bug 1)

 File: server/voice-interview.ts ~line 2139

 Replace the unconditional hardcoded message with a conditional:
 - Detect isLastTemplateQuestion = not in AQ phase AND currentQuestionIndex === questions.length - 1
 - Detect isLastAdditionalQuestion = in AQ phase AND currentAdditionalQuestionIndex === additionalQuestions.length - 1
 - If either is true: message says "This is the LAST question... wrap up naturally... click the button below to continue... Do NOT mention
  a next question"
 - Otherwise: keep existing message

 2. Skip Barbara analysis during AQ phase (Bug 2)

 File: server/voice-interview.ts ~line 1986

 Add early return in triggerBarbaraAnalysis():
 if (state.isInAdditionalQuestionsPhase) return null;
 AQ questions are brief (1-2 follow-ups max) and Barbara's template-oriented analysis doesn't apply. This prevents both the meaningless
 analysis and the destructive instruction overwrite.

 3. Add last-question guideline to AQ instructions (Bug 3)

 File: server/voice-interview.ts ~line 3334 (in buildAQInstructions)

 Add conditional guideline when aqIndex === totalAQs - 1:
 - This is the LAST question in the interview. Do NOT mention a next question or moving on. When the respondent has answered, wrap up
 naturally and tell them they can click the button below to continue.

 4. Add last-question awareness to Barbara's system prompt (defense-in-depth)

 File: server/barbara-orchestrator.ts ~line 362

 Amend the COMPLETENESS EVALUATION and TIME/LENGTH MONITORING instructions to note: "If the UPCOMING QUESTIONS list is empty, this is the
 last question — use none instead of suggest_next_question. Alvia will handle wrapping up."

 Files to Modify

 - server/voice-interview.ts — fixes 1, 2, 3
 - server/barbara-orchestrator.ts — fix 4
 - server/voice-interview/instructions.ts — no changes needed (existing instruction #12 is fine, the issue was that Barbara's guidance was
  overriding it)

 Verification

 1. Run npm run check to verify no type errors
 2. Run npx vitest to verify existing tests pass
 3. Manual test: start interview, advance to last template question, give a thorough answer — verify Alvia says "click the button below"
 not "next question"
 4. Manual test: enter AQ phase, verify console shows [Barbara] Skipping analysis during AQ phase
 5. Manual test: on last AQ, verify Alvia wraps up without mentioning next question
 6. Regression: on question 1 of N, verify normal "shall we move to the next question?" behavior
