Thanks for the crisp summary—VAD tuning is a high‑leverage change, so I read through the implementation with a focus on trigger and recovery behavior.

  Findings

  1. High: Recovery can be permanently blocked after any non‑short quality flag. updateGoodUtteranceTracking treats cumulative counters as current issues; because foreignLanguageCount, incoherentPhraseCount, and
     repeatedWordGlitchCount only ever increment, a single detection makes hasQualityIssues true forever. That prevents consecutiveGoodUtterances from ever reaching 10, so shouldRestoreVadEagerness never fires and VAD
     can get stuck at "low" after the first reduction. References: server/transcription-quality.ts:233-263, server/transcription-quality.ts:431-452, server/transcription-quality.ts:417-425.
  2. High: A single foreign‑language detection permanently disables VAD reduction. The trigger checks foreignLanguageCount === 0, but that count is lifetime and the detector is heuristic regex. One false positive or a
     bilingual respondent means you’ll never reduce eagerness again, even if later short‑utterance streaks clearly indicate VAD timing issues. References: server/transcription-quality.ts:244-249, server/transcription-
     quality.ts:403-412.
  3. Medium: Trigger is short‑utterance‑only and ignores question types where short replies are expected (yes/no, scale, numeric). A run of valid short answers can trip the reduction even when VAD is fine. You already
     track speech timing (speech_started/speech_stopped), which could give a more reliable signal than word count alone. References: server/transcription-quality.ts:267-279, server/transcription-quality.ts:403-412,
     server/voice-interview.ts:2085-2127.
  4. Medium: Eagerness state can desync on provider reconnect. The initial OpenAI session config always sets "auto", and updates only happen on transitions; if the provider WS reconnects while vadEagernessReduced is
     true, the provider may be "auto" while state thinks "low". References: server/realtime-providers.ts:84-104, server/voice-interview.ts:2241-2266.

  Open Questions

  1. For foreign‑language detection in the VAD trigger, which behavior do you want?
      1. Use a recent‑window veto (e.g., “no foreign‑language flags in last N utterances”).
      2. Keep it as a hard veto (current behavior).
      3. Remove it from the VAD trigger entirely.
  2. Should the short‑utterance trigger be disabled for yes_no, scale, and numeric questions?
      1. Yes, always skip those question types.
      2. Only skip when the question explicitly expects short answers.
      3. Keep current behavior.

  Test Gaps

  1. No unit tests for shouldReduceVadEagerness, shouldRestoreVadEagerness, or updateGoodUtteranceTracking; these would catch the “stuck in low” scenario and false‑positive vetoes. References: server/transcription-
     quality.ts.
  2. No integration test that exercises a reconnect while vadEagernessReduced is true.

  What Looks Good

  1. Clean separation from the environment‑check path and clear logging.
  2. Provider‑aware gating (supportsSemanticVAD) avoids touching Grok.
  3. Sanitizing transcripts before “good utterance” evaluation is the right instinct.
