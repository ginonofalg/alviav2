  Current State: The respondents table has an email field that's never populated. Respondents are only created when someone clicks the link and consents — there's no way to pre-register a target list.

  The current sharing UX is functional but bare-bones — essentially treating distribution as an external concern. For a research interview platform, this is a significant gap because:                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  1. Researchers need to track who they've invited vs. who responded                                                                                                                                                                                               
  2. Manual distribution introduces friction and errors                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  3. No visibility into the invitation-to-completion funnel                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  4. The data model already supports richer functionality that isn't exposed                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  The foundation exists in the schema; the UI just needs to surface it with proper contact management and distribution workflows.
