When I land on the first question of a new interview, the question is immediately visible. The previous page ("Welcome to Your Interview", "Before we         
  begin, let's get to know you a little better" hasn't warmed the user up sufficiently to know that the interview will start on the next page. Also, on the     
   first question page, the user must Click the microphone to start the interview. I wonder if in place of the first question, there should be a message?       
  Something like "Ok " {users name [if it's captured]}, Alvia's ready to start. Get comfortable and make sure you're somewhere quiet". What do you think?       
  Propose an approach.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                
● Let me explore the current interview flow to understand the existing UX before proposing an approach.

● Good observation. The current flow has a gap: the welcome page captures names but doesn't set expectations about what's coming next, and then the interview   
  page drops the user straight into the first question with a bare "Click the microphone to start" prompt. There's no moment to settle in.                      
                                                                                                                                                                
  Here's my proposed approach:                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                
  Add a "Get Ready" state within the interview page                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                
  Rather than adding a new route (which adds a page load and more navigation complexity), I'd add a pre-interview readiness phase inside interview.tsx itself — 
  a screen the user sees before they click the mic, replacing the current minimal "Click the microphone to start" prompt.                                       
                                                                                                                                                                
  What the user would see                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                
  When they land on /interview/:sessionId, instead of immediately seeing the first question text and a mic button, they'd see:                                  
                                                                                                                                                                
  A warm, focused readiness screen:                                                                                                                             
  - Greeting: "Ok {informalName}, Alvia's ready when you are" (or "Ok, Alvia's ready when you are" if no name was captured)                                     
  - A brief tip: "Find somewhere quiet and comfortable. The interview will take about {estimated duration}."                                                    
  - A prominent "Start Interview" button (or the mic button, restyled for this context)                                                                         
  - Once clicked, the WebSocket connects, and the UI transitions to the current interview view with the first question                                          
                                                                                                                                                                
  What changes                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                
  1. server/routes.ts — The existing GET /api/interview/:sessionId endpoint already returns session + respondent data. I'd ensure informalName is included in   
  the response if it isn't already.                                                                                                                             
  2. client/src/pages/interview.tsx — Add a readyPhase state (boolean, starts true). When readyPhase is true, render the readiness screen instead of the        
  question/waveform UI. When the user clicks "Start Interview", set readyPhase = false and trigger the existing connectWebSocket() + startAudioCapture() flow.  
  3. No new routes, no new pages — This keeps the URL structure clean and avoids an extra navigation step. The readiness screen is just the initial render state
   of the interview page.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                
  Why this approach                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                
  - Minimal change surface: One page, one new state variable, one new render branch                                                                             
  - No architectural changes: The WebSocket connection still only starts when the user is ready (same as today, just with better UX framing)                    
  - Name is already available: The interview data fetch already loads respondent info — we just need to use informalName in the readiness screen                
  - Works for resumed sessions too: For resumed interviews, we can skip the readiness screen and go straight to the question (the user already knows what       
  they're doing)                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                
  What it doesn't change                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                
  - The welcome page stays as-is (name capture is still its job)                                                                                                
  - The mic permission request can still happen on page mount (so there's no delay when they click "Start")                                                     
  - The first question flow on the server side is unchanged
