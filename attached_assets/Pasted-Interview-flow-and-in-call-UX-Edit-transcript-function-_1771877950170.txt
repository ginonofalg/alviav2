Interview flow and in-call UX

 Edit transcript function at the end of the interview

 Last question detection still flaky, not reliably switching to “complete interview”

 Does “next question” only work when the mic is active?

 Sustained silence UX

 Rotate the “Barbara is analysing” status text (noodling, cogitating, etc.)

 Have Alvia highlight the “next question” and “complete interview” buttons

 Remove occasional copy/prompt references to “next question” button, when it should say “complete interview”

 Alvia needs to know that she’s Alvia, not just “what she introduces herself as”

 Cross-interview threshold, set minimum 5 and make it the default

 Summarisation tidy-up, ensure we’re checking project vs template objectives correctly

 Add section headings for questions

Editor and workspace (projects, templates, sessions)

 Add a bulk session manager

 Need a delete project function

 UI clarity, make it more obvious what is a Project vs Template vs Collection

 Add drag-to-reorder for template questions

 Check date formats used for “last update”, etc.

 Paste questions, robustly extract questions from pasted text, add regression tests (the core function exists, this is the hardening)

Analytics, infographics, simulations, personas

 Update the project analytics refresh, propose updating stale collections/templates where needed

 Infographic storage policy, label Beta, encourage download, no server storage

 [[Max output tokens for persona functionality]]

 Interview simulations, based on digital personas

 Analytics only show if you select all, although all interview sessions for the project are Real

 Analytics staleness indicators are a mess

 Auto-generate personas from data/report/insight

 Pass uploaded files directly to GPT-5, test

 Personas need sub-personas, single persona set is not enough for a whole population

 Check bill logging!!!!

 Launch simulation, add a “select all personas” button

 Simulation runs card not updating in realtime, show granular progress; define reconnection behaviour on disconnect

 Simulation run bar chart goes down and up!

Platform, models, integrations

 Consider switchability between LLMs, and whether an AWS solution is best long term

 [[Domain Intelligence Layer]] assessment

 TTS/STT workflow, drop the custom route for now, go with [[Gemini 3 Alvia Implementation]]

 Test Grok implementation, [[OAI vs Grok in Alvia Report]]; follow verification steps at end

 Test Grok voice, then either support it properly or drop it

 Add langsmith, [[Alvia Langsmith Addition]]

 How could I make her fully API-able?

 Remind myself what the Babs:Alvia API JavaScript looks like

 Responses API, decide whether we want strict JSON schema

 Review [[Claude Code]] recommendation on clipping, reinstate previous commit (which was buggy I think)

Performance, cost, reliability, observability

 Analyse code for token consumption and cost gaps

 Test whether revised token count functionality is more accurate for realtime

 Test token reconciliation

 Reduce the audio bit rate

 Page loads are quite slow

 Log device type, vary “eagerness” on phones based on feedback

 Test a couple of conversations given recent ordering bugs

 Production testing, given extent of LLM changes made tonight

 Create a complete sequenced log of Alvia and Barbara interactions

 8.27, Feb 10th was the last checkpoint prior to the refactoring

 Barbara guidance usage, Phase 2 analysis based on actual data (Phase 1 is marked done)

Commercial and product strategy

 Put in a payment layer

 Create a fix-for-free interview version

 Get [[Fergus Macintosh]] to start flogging the product

 Create a [[boiler installs survey]]

 What’s your Monday metric? You hate work, but you don’t want it automated

 Develop a vertical scaffold, Claude Code style, make Alvia’s value obvious fast

 Think about how a persona generator could integrate with Alvia

Security and assurance

 Review the [[Endpoint Report]]

 Run an endpoint security audit

Research and notes

 Download the latest CogRev YouTube and summarise what he’s saying about personal OS, especially the point about pain in legacy businesses

 Review the [[Alvia Competitor Report]]

 Study on adversarial coding, sycophancy towards me vs a 3rd party’s challenge
