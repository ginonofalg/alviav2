  1. Quality score doesn't penalize repeated word glitches (Bug)                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                       
  In calculateQualityScore() (lines 249-267), repeatedWordGlitchCount is tracked but never penalized:

  2. Sanitization regex has subtle redundancy (Minor)                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                       
  Line 305's second pass regex:                                                                                                                                        
  /\b(\w+)([,.\-;:!?]?\s+\1){3,}\b/gi                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                       
  The ? makes punctuation optional, so after the first pass already handles space-only patterns, the second pass might partially re-match. Not a bug, but could be     
  simplified to require punctuation: [,.\-;:!?]\s+ instead of [,.\-;:!?]?\s+.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                       
  3. shouldTriggerCheck doesn't include repeated word glitches (Design Decision)                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                       
  The environment check trigger (lines 232-247) doesn't factor in repeatedWordGlitchCount. This might be intentional since repeated words indicate connection issues,  
  not environmental noise. Worth confirming the intended behavior.

  Overall Assessment                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                       
  The implementation is solid and addresses the core issues. The main fix needed is adding repeatedWordGlitchCount to the quality score calculation. The response      
  tracking logic looks correct and the sanitization will clean up garbled transcripts effectively.
