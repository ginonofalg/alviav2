 Found it. The issue is in how Alvia's speech transcription is handled — there are two different texts, and the client shows the worse one.                 
                                                                                                                                                             
  The two paths diverge for Alvia's transcript:                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                             
  Database (voice-interview.ts:1422-1435): When the Realtime API fires response.audio_transcript.done, the server stores event.transcript — the final,       
  refined transcript — into liveTranscript.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                             
  Chat window (interview.tsx:440-477): The client builds Alvia's transcript by concatenating streaming delta chunks as they arrive (ai_transcript events,    
  line 448). When ai_transcript_done arrives, it does include the final transcript (message.transcript at line 1440 on the server), but the client ignores it
   — it only flips isStreaming: false (line 472) and keeps the delta-concatenated text.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                             
  // line 472 — keeps the delta-built text, throws away the final transcript                                                                                 
  { ...lastEntry, isStreaming: false }                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                             
  The OpenAI Realtime API generates audio transcript deltas incrementally as the model speaks. The final .done transcript is a post-processed, higher-quality
   version. The client never swaps in that better version.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                             
  The fix is straightforward — in the ai_transcript_done handler, replace the delta-built text with the final transcript:                                    
                                                                                                                                                             
  case "ai_transcript_done":                                                                                                                                 
    setTranscript((prev) => {                                                                                                                                
      const lastEntry = prev[prev.length - 1];                                                                                                               
      if (lastEntry && lastEntry.speaker === "alvia" && lastEntry.isStreaming) {

  This would use the same final transcript that gets stored in liveTranscript.
