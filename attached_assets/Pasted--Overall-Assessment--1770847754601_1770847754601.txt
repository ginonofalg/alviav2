  Overall Assessment                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                            
  The implementation is well-structured — clean code, good test IDs, uses existing UI primitives correctly, respects file size limits, and follows the      
  hybrid architecture (welcome dialog + dashboard card + field guides). But there are meaningful bugs and omissions.                                        
                                                                                                                                                            
  Critical Bugs

  1. Milestone logic is broken due to demo seed data. The demo project auto-creates 1 project + 1 template on first login. The milestones check projectCount
   > 0 and templateCount > 0, so steps 1 ("Explore demo") and 3 ("Add template") are immediately marked as done before the user does anything. Only
  projectCreated correctly uses > 1. This means a new user sees 3 of 4 steps already complete, defeating the purpose of the progressive checklist.

  2. testMode field exists in the TypeScript interface but isn't in the Zod API validation schema, so attempts to set it via the API silently fail. The
  {testMode: false} in handleComplete() is dead code.

  3. Barbara uses the Search icon in the welcome dialog instead of BarChart3 (which is imported but unused). This conflicts with the "Explore the demo" step
   which also uses Search.

  Key Omissions from the Plan

  4. No explicit milestone tracking on creation mutations. The plan called for calling updateOnboarding({ firstProjectCreated: true }) in the onSuccess
  callbacks of creation pages. This was not implemented — milestones are derived purely from count-based stats, which is why the demo data conflation bug
  exists.

  5. completedAt is never set. The field exists in the interface but nothing ever writes a timestamp to it. The onboarding never formally "completes" in the
   database.

  6. No Framer Motion animations. The plan called for slide transitions in the welcome dialog and collapse animations on the field guides. Neither was
  implemented — transitions are instant.

  Design Gaps

  7. Dashboard card step 3 links to /templates (list) instead of template creation within a project. The user has to figure out how to create one from
  there.

  8. "Meet Your AI Team" grid uses grid-cols-2 without a responsive breakpoint. Will be squeezed on mobile — should be grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2.

  9. No "Reset onboarding" in settings — no way to re-trigger the flow for testing or review.

  10. No tests were added for the onboarding hook's non-trivial logic (milestone computation, existing user detection, optimistic updates).
