# Alvia - Voice-Based AI Interview Platform

## Overview

Alvia is a voice-based AI interview platform for qualitative research at scale. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o Real-time API for natural voice conversations, automatically transcribing and analyzing responses. The platform features consent management, PII redaction, cross-interview analysis, and an advanced analytics system providing insights at Collection, Template, and Project levels. It also includes an invitation system for respondent recruitment and a strategic context feature for tailored analytics recommendations, aiming to transform qualitative research through AI-driven efficiency and insight generation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 (TypeScript, Wouter, TanStack React Query, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend**: Express.js with WebSockets
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit OpenID Connect via Passport.js
- **Voice Processing**: OpenAI GPT-4o Real-time API (with multi-provider support for future integration with Grok/xAI)
- **Infographic Generation**: Gemini API (`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`)

### Data Model Hierarchy
The system organizes data hierarchically: **Workspace → Project → InterviewTemplate → Collection → InterviewSession → Segment**.

### Key Design Patterns
- **Storage Abstraction**: Centralized database operations via `DatabaseStorage`.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for live voice interview sessions.
- **Form Validation**: Zod schemas integrated with react-hook-form.
- **API Pattern**: REST endpoints with authentication middleware.
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui.
- **Lag-by-one-turn guidance**: Asynchronous AI guidance for next response.
- **Multi-Level Analytics System**: Analytics generated at Collection, Template, and Project levels, with AI-powered cross-template synthesis at the Project level.
- **Strategic Context Integration**: Enables tailored analytics recommendations based on user-provided business context.
- **Aggregated Analytics Command Center**: Centralized dashboard for cross-project insights and analytics health.
- **Respondent Invitation System**: Supports single and bulk invitations with tracking.
- **Session Hygiene System**: Automatic cleanup of abandoned sessions using heartbeat, idle, and max age timeouts.
- **Session Detail Page Enhancements**: Provides comprehensive tools for researchers including export, notes, flagging, and navigation.
- **Project-Level Infographics**: Extends infographic generation to the project level, alongside collection-level support.
- **PDF Export for Analytics**: Comprehensive PDF export for project and collection analytics with smart page breaks and consistent styling.
- **Analytics Cascade Refresh**: Streamlined UX for refreshing analytics dependencies (collections, templates, projects) via a single "Refresh All" action.
- **Data Isolation**: Enforced ownership verification across all data hierarchies (User → Workspace → Project → Template → Collection → Session) for secure multi-tenancy.
- **Auto-Generate Template Feature**: AI-powered generation of interview templates from project metadata using GPT-5.
- **Multi-Provider Realtime Voice Support**: Abstracted `RealtimeProvider` interface to support switching between different real-time voice API providers (e.g., OpenAI, Grok). Researchers select the provider at the Collection level during creation; respondents automatically use the collection's configured provider.
- **Demo Project Auto-Seeding**: New users automatically receive a demo project ("Alvia Demo — Your Coffee Ritual") with a pre-configured template and 6 questions on first login. Implemented via `server/demo-seed.ts` called from the auth verification callback.
- **Invite-Only Waitlist System**: Gating mechanism for public launch. Only users with emails in the `invite_list` table can access the platform. Non-invited authenticated users see a waitlist form to submit their information (name, email, consent preferences). Controlled by `INVITE_ONLY_MODE` environment variable (defaults to true; set to "false" to disable gating). Database tables: `invite_list` (invited emails) and `waitlist_entries` (waitlist submissions). To invite users: `INSERT INTO invite_list (email) VALUES ('user@example.com');`
- **Additional Questions Feature**: AI-powered follow-up questions generated by Barbara (AI analyst) after completing template questions. Configurable per collection (0-3 questions, default 1). Includes opt-in consent dialog, loading states during Barbara's analysis, and dedicated AQ navigation UI. WebSocket protocol extended with new message types for AQ flow. Controlled by `ADDITIONAL_QUESTIONS_ENABLED` environment variable (defaults to true; set to "false" to disable). AQ segments stored in session's `additionalQuestions` JSONB field and displayed separately in review page with "AQ" badges.
- **Silent Ambient Calibration**: Automatic microphone calibration when silence monitoring starts. Measures ambient noise during AnalyserNode warmup period (first 2.5s) and computes a dynamic silence detection threshold using formula: `clamp(baseline × 3.0, 0.005, 0.12)`. Includes safeguards for high variance environments, background tab throttling, and fallback to hardcoded threshold (0.01) on failure. Calibration results sent to server for diagnostics. Implementation in `client/src/hooks/use-silence-detection.ts`.
- **Enhanced Transcription Quality Handling**: Environment check triggers on first foreign language hallucination (not 2+). Re-triggering enabled after 5-utterance cooldown when quality issues persist. Implemented via guard reset logic in `server/voice-interview.ts` and reduced cooldown in `server/transcription-quality.ts`.
- **WebSocket Connection Cleanup**: Uses `removeAllListeners()` before `close()` for instant cleanup of orphaned provider/client connections, preventing stale event processing. ConnectionId guards remain as secondary safety net.
- **Session Duration Tracking**: `totalDurationMs` now centrally computed in `finalizeAndPersistMetrics` and persisted to database for data integrity.
- **Dynamic VAD Eagerness Adjustment**: Mid-session adjustment of OpenAI's semantic VAD eagerness. When `shortUtteranceStreak >= 4` with no foreign language hallucinations (indicating VAD timing issues, not transcription quality), eagerness is reduced from "auto" to "low". Restored to "auto" after 10 consecutive good utterances (≥3 words, no quality issues). Tracked via `vadEagernessReduced` and `consecutiveGoodUtterances` in TranscriptionQualitySignals. Only applies to OpenAI (Grok uses server_vad). Implementation in `server/voice-interview.ts:sendVadEagernessUpdate()` and `server/transcription-quality.ts`.
