# TechLocal Proposal: Alvia + Smart Working Revolution

## Context

**Competition**: TechLocal: Connecting Local Talent to Local Tech Jobs (Innovate UK, Ref 2378)
**Funding**: £100k-£225k per project | 6-9 months | Start July 2026
**National targets**: 1,000 new tech jobs placed, 4,000+ SMEs supported
**Deadline**: 18 March 2026 at 11:00 AM

**Partners**:
- **Alvia** (Lead applicant) — AI-powered qualitative research platform with voice interviewing, persona simulation, and hierarchical analytics
- **Smart Working Revolution (SWR)** (Collaborator) — Workforce transformation consultancy with 20+ years experience, 60+ workforce solutions, SMARTER Framework

**Problem being solved**: The persistent gap between completing tech training and actually securing employment. Training providers produce candidates; employers have vacancies; yet the two sides consistently fail to connect. The barrier is not a lack of supply or demand — it's a lack of deep, evidence-based understanding of what each side actually needs, at scale.

## Proposal Summary: "TechBridge"

**One-liner**: An AI-powered demand intelligence and placement readiness system that uses deep qualitative interviews — at scale — to understand what SME employers actually need, assess what candidates actually have, and bridge the gap with targeted interventions.

### The Innovation

Traditional employment support programs rely on job descriptions, skills taxonomies, and self-reported candidate CVs. These surface-level data sources miss the real barriers: employer risk aversion, candidate confidence gaps, cultural fit uncertainties, and unarticulated skill needs that never make it into a job spec.

**TechBridge** uses Alvia's AI interviewing platform to conduct structured, deep qualitative research with both employers and candidates — extracting the tacit knowledge, unspoken concerns, and real decision-making factors that determine whether a hire happens and whether it sticks.

This is not a chatbot or a survey. Alvia conducts genuine research-grade interviews: adaptive follow-up questions, real-time analysis by an AI orchestrator (Barbara), cross-interview theme detection, and hierarchical analytics that synthesise findings across hundreds of conversations into actionable intelligence.

## How It Works: Four Phases

### Phase 1: Demand Intelligence (Months 1-2)
**Objective**: Build a granular, evidence-based map of what SME employers in frontier tech actually need from entry-level hires.

**Using Alvia**:

1. **Population Research** — Alvia's persona generation system researches the target employer population using web search, gathering demographic distributions, hiring patterns, and sector-specific data for the chosen region(s). This produces a structured `PopulationBrief` covering company size segments, sector breakdowns, and behavioural patterns around hiring.

2. **Synthetic Pre-Research** — Before engaging real employers (saving time and refining approach), generate 6-8 employer personas representing archetypal SME hiring managers: the growth-stage AI startup founder, the cautious cybersecurity firm HR lead, the semiconductor manufacturer needing technicians, etc. Run 40-60 simulated interviews to pre-identify likely themes and stress-test the interview template.

3. **AI Template Generation** — Alvia auto-generates a research-grade interview template from the project context (e.g., "Understand hiring barriers and entry-level skill requirements for frontier tech SMEs in [region]"). The template covers: current hiring processes, common rejection reasons, unarticulated skill needs, risk factors in hiring juniors, what would de-risk a hire, attitudes to training partnerships.

4. **Real Employer Interviews** — Conduct 50-80 voice interviews with real SME employers/hiring managers across the target region. Alvia handles scheduling, consent, voice interviewing, transcription, and real-time quality monitoring. Barbara (the AI orchestrator) provides live guidance during each interview — probing deeper on important themes, detecting topic overlap with prior interviews, and ensuring coverage of all research objectives.

5. **Cross-Interview Analytics** — Alvia's hierarchical analytics system processes all interviews:
   - **Collection level**: Themes on hiring barriers, skill priorities, risk perceptions — with verbatim quotes
   - **Template level**: Question effectiveness and consistency across employer segments
   - **Project level**: Executive summary with strategic insights, contextual recommendations, and curated verbatims for reports
   - Key outputs: consensus points (where employers agree), divergence points (where views differ by sector/size), emergent themes (things we didn't think to ask about)

**Deliverable**: An "Employer Demand Intelligence Report" — not a generic skills framework, but a granular, evidence-based map of what employers actually need, what they're worried about, and what would make them hire.

### Phase 2: Candidate Assessment & Readiness Profiling (Months 2-4)
**Objective**: Assess trained candidates' actual readiness for employment — beyond what certificates and CVs show.

**Using Alvia**:

1. **Candidate Interview Templates** — Generate templates focused on: technical confidence (self-assessed vs. demonstrated), communication skills, workplace readiness, understanding of employer expectations, barriers to applying, support needs. Include both open questions and structured scales for quantifiable metrics.

2. **Scalable 1:1 Assessment** — Each candidate completes a 15-20 minute Alvia voice interview. This is not a test — it's a supportive, conversational assessment that surfaces:
   - Confidence gaps (where candidates undervalue their skills)
   - Knowledge gaps (where training didn't fully land)
   - Soft skill readiness (communication, problem-solving, professional conduct)
   - Barriers to employment (transport, caring responsibilities, accessibility)
   - Sector preferences and motivations

3. **Cross-Candidate Analytics** — Aggregate findings across all candidates:
   - Common confidence gaps by demographic segment
   - Skills that training programs consistently under-deliver
   - Barriers that can be addressed vs. barriers that need accommodation
   - Candidate segments: "ready now", "ready with targeted support", "needs further development"

**Deliverable**: Individual readiness profiles per candidate + aggregate "Candidate Readiness Report" identifying systematic gaps.

### Phase 3: Smart Matching & Targeted Interventions (Months 3-6)
**Objective**: Bridge the gap between employer needs and candidate readiness with precision interventions.

**Using Alvia + SWR Together**:

1. **Gap Analysis** — Alvia's project-level analytics compare employer demand intelligence against candidate readiness data. The system identifies:
   - Skills employers prioritise that candidates lack → **targeted upskilling modules** (delivered by SWR)
   - Confidence gaps where candidates have skills but don't know it → **confidence-building workshops** (SWR)
   - Employer risk perceptions that don't match reality → **employer awareness sessions** (SWR)
   - Cultural/workplace readiness gaps → **workplace integration training** via SWR's SMARTER Framework

2. **SWR Delivers Targeted Training** — Based on Alvia's evidence, SWR designs and delivers:
   - Short, focused upskilling modules addressing specific identified gaps (not generic training)
   - Interview preparation using real employer language and priorities (drawn from Alvia verbatims)
   - Workplace readiness coaching using the SMARTER Framework
   - Manager onboarding training for SME employers receiving new hires (reducing early attrition)
   - Specific support pathways for women in tech (informed by gender-disaggregated interview data)

3. **Evidence-Based Matching** — Candidates are matched to employers not just on technical skills, but on the deeper compatibility factors surfaced through interviews: communication style, learning orientation, sector motivation, workplace culture fit.

4. **Pre-Placement Simulation** — Use Alvia's simulation engine to run "practice interviews" with AI personas modelled on actual employer archetypes from Phase 1. Candidates practice answering the kinds of questions and discussing the topics that real employers in their target sector care about.

**Deliverable**: Matched candidate-employer pairs with supporting evidence. Targeted training interventions delivered. Candidates prepared with employer-specific insights.

### Phase 4: Placement, Monitoring & Continuous Learning (Months 4-9)
**Objective**: Place candidates, monitor success, and build a self-sustaining evidence base.

**Using Alvia**:

1. **Placement Support** — Employer-ready candidates introduced to matched SMEs with evidence packs showing skills alignment (drawn from Alvia analytics).

2. **30/60/90 Day Check-In Interviews** — Alvia conducts structured check-in interviews with both placed candidates AND their employers at 30, 60, and 90 days:
   - Are expectations being met on both sides?
   - What additional support is needed?
   - What's working well? What's not?
   - Early warning detection for at-risk placements

3. **Continuous Analytics** — Check-in data feeds back into the analytics hierarchy:
   - Which matching factors predicted successful placements?
   - Which training interventions had the most impact?
   - Where do placements fail, and why?
   - Real vs. simulated data comparison (validating that simulation insights match reality)

4. **Playbook Generation** — The accumulated evidence produces a replicable playbook:
   - Which interview questions best predict employer needs
   - Which candidate assessment dimensions matter most
   - Which interventions have highest ROI
   - A trained set of interview templates that can be reused in other regions

**Deliverable**: Placed candidates in sustained employment (25+ hrs/week). Evidence-based playbook for scaling to other regions.

## Alignment with Competition Assessment Criteria

### Need or Challenge (Q9)
- Evidence-based: Phase 1 produces hard data on regional employer needs (not assumptions)
- Aligns with local skills strategies: interview data can be cross-referenced with LSIPs and local growth plans
- Addresses specific frontier tech sectors with sector-specific insights
- Quantifies the demand-supply mismatch with real employer and candidate voices

### Approach (Q10)
- **Novel**: No existing employment program uses AI-powered deep qualitative research at scale to understand both sides of the hiring equation
- **Scalable**: Alvia can interview 50-100 people per week with minimal marginal cost per interview
- **Evidence-driven**: Every intervention is justified by cross-interview analytics, not assumptions
- **Integrates with existing services**: Interview data can inform DWP Jobcentre referrals, Growth and Skills Levy training priorities, LSIP action plans

### Team and Resources (Q11)
- **Alvia**: Production-grade AI interview platform with voice, simulation, analytics, and reporting capabilities already built and operational
- **SWR**: 20+ years workforce transformation experience, 60+ training solutions, UK-wide delivery capability
- **Complementary expertise**: Alvia provides the intelligence layer; SWR provides the human delivery layer

### Added Value and Impact (Q12)
- **Jobs created**: Target 30-50 placements per project (25+ hrs/week, 6+ month contracts)
- **SMEs supported**: 50-80 employers interviewed and engaged; subset become hiring partners
- **Women in tech**: Gender-disaggregated analytics identify specific barriers for women; SWR delivers targeted support; track women's placement rate as KPI
- **Frontier tech sectors**: Employer interviews segmented by sector; analytics reveal sector-specific needs
- **Measurable KPIs**: Interview completion rates, candidate readiness scores (pre/post training), placement rates, 90-day retention rates, employer satisfaction scores — all captured natively by Alvia

### Outputs and Continuation (Q13)
- **Self-sustaining model**: The interview templates, persona models, and analytics playbook are reusable assets. After the funded period, the system can be redeployed in new regions with minimal setup.
- **Commercial model**: Alvia + SWR can offer "TechBridge" as a service to local authorities, LEPs, combined authorities, and training providers nationally
- **Data asset**: The accumulated demand intelligence becomes more valuable over time as more regions are added
- **Scalability**: The same platform scales from 50 to 5,000 interviews without architectural changes

### Risks (Q15)
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Low employer interview participation | Simulation pre-research validates approach; employer engagement strategy via local business networks; incentive through early access to matched candidates |
| Candidate drop-off | Voice interviews are accessible and low-friction (no forms, no travel); SWR provides ongoing engagement |
| Placement quality | 30/60/90 day check-ins detect issues early; analytics identify at-risk placements for intervention |
| Technology adoption by SMEs | Not asking SMEs to adopt tech — Alvia interviews them, SWR supports them; the technology is invisible to employers |
| Data quality from simulation | Simulation is used for pre-research and template refinement only; all decisions based on real interview data, with simulation/real comparison analytics built in |

## Why This is Innovative

1. **Deep qualitative research at scale** — Traditional employment programs use surveys, focus groups, or anecdotal feedback. Alvia conducts hundreds of structured voice interviews with AI-powered analysis, producing research-grade insights at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional qualitative research.

2. **Both sides of the equation** — Most programs focus on either supply (training candidates) or demand (engaging employers), not both simultaneously with the same rigour. TechBridge interviews both sides and uses cross-analysis to find the actual gaps.

3. **Simulation for rapid iteration** — Before investing in real interviews, synthetic persona simulation tests hypotheses, refines templates, and identifies likely themes. This means the real interviews are sharper and more productive from day one.

4. **Evidence-based matching over CV matching** — Placement decisions based on deep compatibility analysis (communication style, learning orientation, workplace culture preferences) not just keyword matching on skills lists.

5. **Continuous learning loop** — Post-placement check-in interviews feed back into the system, building an evidence base that improves matching accuracy over time. The system gets smarter with every placement.

6. **Transferable and scalable** — The interview templates, persona models, and analytics playbooks produced are reusable assets. Deploying TechBridge in a second region requires configuration, not rebuilding.

## Suggested Frontier Tech Focus

Given the partnership and capabilities, the strongest sectors to target would be:

1. **Artificial Intelligence** — Alvia itself is an AI product; the team has deep domain expertise. AI has the broadest entry-level opportunity spectrum (data annotation, prompt engineering, AI ops, testing, deployment).

2. **Cyber Security** — High demand, well-defined entry-level pathways (SOC analyst, security operations), and a sector with particular gender diversity challenges that the women-in-tech focus would address.

These two sectors have the highest volume of SME employers and the most accessible entry-level roles, maximising placement potential within the project timeline.

---

## Suggested Regional Focus

To be determined based on partner networks. Strongest candidates would be regions where:
- SWR has existing delivery presence and employer relationships
- There is a concentration of AI/Cyber SMEs
- There are existing training pipelines producing candidates (bootcamps, apprenticeships, university programmes) who struggle to convert to employment
- Local skills strategies (LSIPs) explicitly identify frontier tech as a priority

---

## Next Steps

1. Confirm SWR's preferred delivery region(s) and existing employer networks
2. Identify specific training pipelines in the region that produce candidates struggling to find employment
3. Confirm SWR's capacity to deliver targeted training modules within the project timeline
4. Draft detailed work packages and Gantt chart for the 6-9 month period
5. Quantify realistic placement targets for the chosen region (minimum: contribute meaningfully to the 1,000 jobs national target)
6. Identify additional collaboration partners (e.g., local authority, university, Jobcentre Plus)
7. Prepare application for submission by 18 March 2026
